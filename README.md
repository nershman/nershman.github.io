Based off of the minimal website "John Doe" by cadars: https://github.com/cadars/john-doe/

I've added  a very simple PHP script which generates pages from separate HTML files for content and page styling.

todo: 

* use some simple php for a blog? my tiny thing would be... dangerous.

index
|---{folders for permalinked pages (imb, etc). also holds any files related to each proj}
|---blog
| 	|--{html files of articles}
|
|--- index.html (contains home,about,portfolio)
