Notes on planning:
As I add more projects, I can place them all in blog and keep highlights in portfolio.
If I end up writing non-portfolio stuff in blog then I can add a list to #home again for a bigger list than in portfolio

                <h2> Overview </h2>
              <p> This was the final project for a class on Machine Learning at TSE. The goal was to research and evaluate different methods for dealing with imbalanced data. Classification of imbalanced data can pose unique challenges when a certain type of erros is more costly than another. Credit card fraud is a good example: false negatives are more costly than false positives. Additionally, fraud is underrepresented in the data which makes it more difficult to train a model for it.</p>
              <p>We implemented and evaluated 7 different methods. 5 of htese were loss based, including the novel approach Asymmetric Loss and one state of the art method Focal Loss. 2 of the methods were sampling based.</p>
              <p> Evaluation and recommendations were given in two different contexts:
                <ul><li>General model performance on imbalanced data</li><li>Performance for fraud detection</li></ul></p>
              <p>In the general context, Asymmetric loss had the best performance thanks to a large ROC-AUC and rapid convergence. In the application to fraud detection, Asymmetric loss was also the best choice due to minimizing monetary losses and having good Prectision-Recall.</p>

              <p>To evaluate the different approaches, the ROC-AUC curve, model speed, and reliability of convergence were examined. </p>
              <h2>Data Source</h2>
              <p>For this project a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"> public dataset</a> of labelled credit card fraud data. Features consisted of 28 columns from PCA<label for ="pca">1</label><input id = "pca" type="checkbox"><small>Principal Component Analysis</small> alongside time and transaction amount.</p>
              <h2>Tools Used</h2>

              <p><center>Python, Keras, TensorFlow, sklearn, CNNs </center></p>
